Task:

Full CI/CD Pipeline for Dockerized Web App on AWS EC2
Design and implement a simple web application (Node.js, Python, or static HTML).

Version control with Git, using feature branches and pull requests.

Build Docker image via GitHub Actions, push to Docker Hub (free tier).

Provision AWS EC2 instance using Terraform; ensure security group and IAM best practices.

Use Ansible to configure the EC2 instance, deploy the Docker container, and manage app lifecycle.

Add basic health-check monitoring (Prometheus + node_exporter or simple script).

Automate deployment: Every merge to main triggers the CI/CD pipeline.

Document steps and automation in README.
